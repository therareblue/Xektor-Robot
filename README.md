# Xektor-Robot
I've built a small robot with raspberry pi zero w board (and couple of Arduino pro micro, testing a reinforcement learning model (policy gradient learning model), capable of learning from its experience. It is not perfect, but it's working.

Peripherials:
The Python computer is Raspberry Pi Zero W
1 Arduino Pro Micro for "output" control (motors, LEDs) as well as collecting data from sensors (except the head).
1 Arduino Pro Micro for the "head", controlling the head servoes and taking data from the laser distance sensor.
IMU (Inertial measurement unit) sensor collecting compass, acceleration, gyro and barometer data
INNA power consumption sensor
4 laser distance sensors on front and back
1 laser distance sensor on the head
2 DC motors for robot moving
3 servoes for the 3D moving the head.
LiIon batteries
Charge-discharge boards

Here in Github you can find all the code (Python and Arduino-C++).
You can watch some presentation video from my blog (the video is not instructable): https://youtu.be/FAZZXZPzsS8
No 3d files are yet uploaded. But on interest, contact me on bezgranichen@gmail.com
