# Xektor-Robot
I've built a small robot with raspberry pi zero w board (and couple of Arduino pro micro, testing a reinforcement learning model (policy gradient learning model), capable of learning from its experience. It is not perfect, but it's working.

Peripherials:

The Python computer is Raspberry Pi Zero W</br>
1 Arduino Pro Micro for "output" control (motors, LEDs) as well as collecting data from sensors (except the head)</br>
1 Arduino Pro Micro for the "head", controlling the head servoes and taking data from the laser distance sensor</br>
IMU (Inertial measurement unit) sensor collecting compass, acceleration, gyro and barometer data</br>
INNA power consumption sensor</br>
4 laser distance sensors on front and back</br>
1 laser distance sensor on the head</br>
2 DC motors for robot moving</br>
3 servoes for the 3D moving the head</br>
LiIon batteries</br>
Charge-discharge boards

Here in Github you can find all the code (Python and Arduino-C++).</br>
You can watch some presentation video from my blog (the video is not instructable): https://youtu.be/FAZZXZPzsS8</br>
No 3d files are yet uploaded. But on interest, contact me on bezgranichen@gmail.com</br>
